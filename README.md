# 🧠 Language Detection using Python

This is a capstone project that aims to detect the language of a given text using Python. The project leverages a labeled dataset of multilingual text samples and applies traditional machine learning techniques for classification.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a language detection system that can accurately identify the language of input text. Unlike translation services, this tool is designed solely to classify the input language among a set of known languages based on patterns in the text.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Supports detection of multiple languages
- Uses basic NLP techniques (like character-level or word-level features)
- Built using scikit-learn and pandas
- Interactive code notebook for step-by-step analysis
- Easy to understand and modify for beginners

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib` (for visualization)
  - `seaborn` (if used)
  - `joblib` (for model saving/loading)
